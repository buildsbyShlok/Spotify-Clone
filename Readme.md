## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The audio files and metadata are loaded into a JavaScript array.  
2. Clicking a song updates the audio source and UI dynamically.  
3. JavaScript listens for play/pause events and updates icons accordingly.  
4. The progress bar reflects current playback time and allows seeking.  
5. Playlist items highlight while playing, matching Spotify’s behavior.
